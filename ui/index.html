        <div class="text box">Daffodils, the flowers symbolizing friendship, are some of the most popular flowers exclusively due to their unmatched beauty. Daffodils belong to the genus Narcissus. Daffodil flowers have a trumpet-shaped structure set against a star-shaped background. Often the trumpet is in a contrasting color from the background.

        <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud <br>That floats on high o'er vales and hills, <br>When all at once I saw a crowd, <br>A host, of golden daffodils;<br> Beside the lake, beneath the trees, <br> Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. </p>
