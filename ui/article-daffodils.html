        <div class="textbox"><p>Daffodils, the flowers symbolizing friendship, are some of the most popular flowers exclusively due to their unmatched beauty. Daffodils belong to the genus Narcissus. <strong>Daffodil flowers have a trumpet-shaped structure set against a star-shaped background.</strong> Often the trumpet is in a contrasting color from the background.</p>
            <p>These easy and reliable spring-flowering bulbs multiply quickly and return to bloom year after year. They are not fussy about soil, will grow in sun or shade and are not bothered by deer and other critters.Though yellow is by far the most common color for daffodils, the flowers also come in white, cream, orange and even pink. </p>

                    <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud <br>That floats on high o'er vales and hills, <br>When all at once I saw a crowd, <br>A host, of golden daffodils;<br> Beside the lake, beneath the trees, <br> Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. </p>
